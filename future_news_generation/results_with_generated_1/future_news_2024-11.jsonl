Inferring what stage of development might be reached by 2024-11:\n   - The economy would have likely seen continued recovery from the pandemic, with inflation still being a key concern for central banks.\n   - The Federal Reserve would have likely continued to raise interest rates to fight inflation.\n   - Global trade and commerce would have continued to recover, but with lingering effects from the pandemic.\n   - Technological advancements would have continued to reshape industries and markets.\n\n3.
